# Lane_Detection
When self driving car run on a road.Then, the lane detection techniques help them to follow their perspective lane and save them different incidents.
Following parts I'll cover in this resporiatory.
-> Canny_Edge (That change the whole road into 2-D form).
-> Hough_Transform (connect the most likely edges and draw them an given line on it).
-> Hough_Transform_Quadrilateral (That may change different edges lines into one more likely lane).
-> color_Region (That change the lane into your given color and that color identified by your autonomous car).
